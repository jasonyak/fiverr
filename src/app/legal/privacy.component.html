        SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and
        disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform
        the services they provide to us.

        and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies
        in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your
        purchase-related transactions.

        facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us.

        the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its
        facilities are located.

    <p>
        As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is

        personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to
        disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.
